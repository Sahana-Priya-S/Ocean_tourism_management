# Ocean Tourism Database Management System

The ocean tourism industry currently faces challenges due to inefficient manual data management and the absence of a centralized system. To address these issues, we propose developing an Ocean Tourism Database Management System (DBMS). This system will leverage Firebase for data storage and a user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Our DBMS will serve as the backbone of an ocean exploration tourism website, providing a platform for adventurous travelers to discover and book exciting tours. By effectively managing vast amounts of tour data, the DBMS will enable advanced search functionalities, allowing users to find tours based on their preferences. Additionally, a robust booking system integrated with the DBMS will ensure seamless and secure transactions.

Ultimately, this project aims to streamline operations, enhance customer experience, and support data-driven decision-making within the ocean tourism industry.
